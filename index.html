            <p>My personal secretary said,  Crazies have the minds of kids, constantly asking why. Their minds are insatiable and they are not afraid to follow the rabbit hole no matter how deep down it goes. This allows them to see life as not full of problems, but full of wonder and potential. This ability to always see the glass half full makes the crazies more likely to succeed.</p>

            <p> My inner thought is "Failure is one of the greatest tools in the learning process. Unfortunately, too many people are simply overwhelmed by the feeling of failure rather than being able to stand back and look at the lessons it can teach us. Having the tenacity to stare down failure is an extraordinary skill".</p>

            <p>There comes a time in everyoneâ€™s life when you get tired of being sane and acting sane. There are times when you just want to let go, act stupid, and have fun. And if that is what you decide, there are a lot of things that you can do. </p>
